# Retail Store Sample App - GitOps with Amazon EKS Auto Mode
This project demonstrates a Retail Store microservices application deployed on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using a DevSecOps + GitOps pipeline.
The infrastructure is fully automated with Terraform, and application delivery is handled through ArgoCD using Helm charts for Kubernetes manifests and manifest files.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end automated CI/CD pipeline using GitOps principles.
It integrates DevSecOps, Terraform, Docker, Helm, ArgoCD, and Amazon EKS Auto Mode to manage and secure application deployment efficiently.

Architecture Components
1.	Retail Store App ‚Äî A containerized sample web app.
2.	Docker ‚Äî Builds and packages app images.
3.	Terraform ‚Äî Provisions AWS infrastructure and EKS cluster.
4.	Helm ‚Äî Manages Kubernetes manifests as versioned charts.
5.	ArgoCD ‚Äî Automates GitOps deployment to EKS.
6.	EKS Auto Mode ‚Äî Dynamically manages node provisioning.
7.	DevSecOps Tools ‚Äî Security scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Trivy, Checkov).

üí° This is an automated application integrating DevSecOps, Terraform, Docker, GitOps, ArgoCD, and EKS Cluster.
Kubernetes manifests will be generated using Helm, which acts as a package manager for Kubernetes.
